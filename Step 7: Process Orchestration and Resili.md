Step 7: Process Orchestration and Resilience (Phase 3 – Job Orchestration & Resilience)
Overview

As AIDE moves toward autonomous operation on complex systems, it must manage multiple processes, services, and containers. The seventh step introduces process orchestration—the ability to bring up and tear down services (e.g., databases, message queues, web servers) and to coordinate them during tests. Additionally, this step equips the system to handle failures gracefully via resilience mechanisms. A new orchestration tool is added to the agent’s toolkit, and the tester and critic agents are expanded to handle distributed, multi‑process environments. At the end of this step, AIDE will be able to spin up a composed system, run end‑to‑end tests against it, and recover from simulated failures such as crashed services.
System Components

    Process Orchestrator Tool: A new tool that exposes high‑level operations over Docker or Docker Compose. It supports commands such as compose_up, compose_down, restart_service, and tail_logs. This allows the agents to start all services defined in a docker-compose.yml file, check health, and stop them after tests.

    Chaos Hooks: Fault injection primitives that simulate failures in a controlled manner. Examples include killing a service process, dropping network packets, or introducing latency. These are used by the tester or a dedicated resilience agent to ensure the system behaves correctly under fault conditions.

    Enhanced Tester Agent: Capable of orchestrating the environment: it can call compose_up to launch the services, run functional and performance tests against the system, inject chaos events, and then shut down the environment.

    Resilience Agent (optional): A specialised node that monitors for failures during execution. It validates that the system recovers gracefully (e.g., job rescheduling, no data loss) and provides recommendations.

    Concurrency Module: A mechanism that allows the orchestrator to launch and manage parallel workflows for tasks that are independent of one another. Many operations—such as fetching documentation, generating a high‑level project outline, or starting auxiliary services—do not depend on each other and can run concurrently. By allowing multiple agents to work simultaneously and synchronising only when their results are needed, the system can reduce overall runtime and improve responsiveness. LangGraph supports this pattern by allowing nodes to execute in parallel branches

Implementation Requirements

    Define orchestration interface

        Implement a new tool accessible to agents with methods:

            compose_up(compose_file: str): Launch all services defined in a Docker Compose file and wait until they are healthy (as defined by healthcheck settings).

            compose_down(compose_file: str): Tear down the services.

            restart_service(service_name: str): Restart a single service in the Compose environment.

            tail_logs(service_name: str, lines: int): Retrieve the last n lines of logs for debugging.

        Validate input paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. Ensure commands are run with timeouts.

    Chaos hooks

        Provide functions such as kill_service(service_name: str) and drop_network(service_a: str, service_b: str, duration: float). These inject faults for testing resilience. Limit usage to local simulation; do not allow arbitrary process kills outside of the compose environment.

        Expose these hooks to the tester or resilience agent via a JSON API.

    Concurrency support

        Implement concurrency primitives in the orchestration layer. When the planner or orchestrator identifies tasks that do not depend on each other (e.g., generating a research report while simultaneously drafting a high‑level project outline), it should spin up separate agent processes or asynchronous tasks to execute them in parallel. The orchestrator must track these tasks and join them once they complete.

        Extend the tester and critic agents to handle concurrent observations. For example, test execution can occur while documentation is being fetched; once both are finished, the critic incorporates all results into its analysis. Provide a scheduling mechanism that clearly marks dependencies to prevent race conditions.

        Use the parallel workflow support in LangGraph to model these branches
        medium.com
        . Define a merge point where the outputs of concurrent branches are collected before proceeding.

    Agent modifications

        Update the tester to use the orchestration tool at the start of an end‑to‑end test. It should call compose_up, run the suite of tests, optionally call chaos hooks, and finally call compose_down.

        Add resilience checks: the tester should monitor whether the system recovers after a fault injection (e.g., a worker process crash) and whether jobs are properly rescheduled or messages are not lost.

        The critic should include resilience issues in its change requests if the system fails to meet fault tolerance expectations.

    Testing procedure

        Use Project 3 – Distributed Job Scheduler as the primary test case. Write an integration test that:

            Calls compose_up to start the scheduler, workers, and database.

            Submits several jobs via the API.

            Kills one worker via kill_service and verifies that unfinished jobs are reassigned to the remaining workers.

            Restarts the killed worker and checks that it rejoins the worker pool.

            Tears down the environment with compose_down.

        Measure the system’s resilience: verify that no jobs are lost and that the API reports correct status throughout.

        Document failures and ensure the critic generates appropriate change requests.

    Deliverables

        Implementation of the orchestration tool and chaos hooks.

        Updated agent logic to coordinate service startup and shutdown.

        Example integration tests demonstrating fault injection and recovery in the scheduler project.

Notes

Process orchestration is essential for testing realistic systems that consist of multiple services. By integrating fault injection, we ensure that the autonomous programming system builds software that is not only correct and fast but also resilient. This step sets the stage for the final addition of policy‑based routing in Step 8.
